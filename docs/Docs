AI-Driven Modern Workplace with Intune and Jamf: Documentation
Overview
This project focuses on building a modern workplace that leverages AI-driven automation, Microsoft Intune, Jamf Pro, and Azure Sentinel. It includes scripts for managing macOS and Windows devices, enforcing security policies, and integrating cross-platform management for an optimized, secure environment.

Structure:
Scripts/:
AppleScripts/: Scripts for automating tasks on macOS.
ShellScripts/: Shell scripts for macOS security and system configuration.
Intune_Policies/: Policies for managing Windows and macOS devices through Microsoft Intune.
Jamf_Scripts/: Scripts for enforcing policies and managing macOS devices via Jamf Pro.
Azure_Sentinel_Playbooks/: Playbooks for automating incident responses and threat intelligence sharing using Azure Sentinel.
1. Scripts/
1.1 AppleScripts/
Slack_Install.applescript
Purpose: Automates the installation of Slack on macOS devices via Jamf.
Functionality: This AppleScript installs the Slack app for macOS without user interaction, ensuring it is silently deployed across managed devices.
  
  tell application "System Events"
    display dialog "Installing Slack..."
end tell

do shell script "curl -O https://downloads.slack-edge.com/mac_releases/Slack-4.0.0.dmg"
do shell script "hdiutil attach Slack-4.0.0.dmg"
do shell script "cp -R /Volumes/Slack/Slack.app /Applications"
do shell script "hdiutil detach /Volumes/Slack"

  1.2 ShellScripts/
Firewall_Enable.sh
Purpose: This script enables the firewall on macOS devices and ensures all incoming connections are blocked for enhanced security.
Functionality: The script is deployed via Jamf or manually and ensures that firewall settings are consistently applied across the enterprise.

  #!/bin/bash

echo "Enabling firewall and blocking all incoming connections..."

# Enable firewall
sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 1

# Block all incoming connections
sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf allowsignedenabled -bool false

# Confirm firewall settings
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate


  2. Intune_Policies/
macOS Compliance Policy with Intune and Jamf Integration
Purpose: This policy ensures that all macOS devices meet compliance requirements such as encryption (FileVault) and are running the latest OS version.
Functionality: This policy integrates with Jamf Pro to sync compliance status between Intune and Jamf.
Key Compliance Requirements:

FileVault Encryption: Enforced on all macOS devices.
OS Version: macOS devices must be running at least version 11.0.
Password Complexity: Minimum 8 characters, with at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number.
3. Jamf_Scripts/
macOS Compliance Sync with Intune
Purpose: This script syncs the compliance status of macOS devices from Jamf to Intune, ensuring that devices are properly enrolled and compliant across both platforms.
Functionality: Automates the process of syncing device status, making it easier to maintain compliance in a hybrid Jamf-Intune environment.

  #!/bin/bash

# Ensure compliance sync between Jamf and Intune
jamf recon
sudo jamf policy -event syncWithIntune
echo "macOS device compliance synced with Intune."


  4. Azure_Sentinel_Playbooks/
4.1 Phishing Email Response Playbook
Purpose: Automatically responds to a phishing email detected by Azure Sentinel by isolating the affected device, blocking the sender in Office 365, and notifying the security team.
Functionality: The playbook ensures an automated response to phishing attempts, mitigating potential security risks without manual intervention.
Key Actions:

Device Isolation: Isolate the device to prevent further damage.
Block Email Sender: Automatically block the phishing email sender in Office 365.
Notify Security Team: Send an alert to the security team for follow-up.

        "body": "A phishing email has been detected and the affected machine has been isolated."
      }
    }
  }
}
