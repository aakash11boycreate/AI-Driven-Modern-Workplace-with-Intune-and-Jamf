# AI-Driven-Modern-Workplace-with-Intune-and-Jamf
AI-powered modern workplace solution integrating Microsoft 365, Jamf Pro, and Intune for macOS management. Automates workflows, enhances security, and ensures compliance.
AI-Driven Modern Workplace with Microsoft 365, Jamf Pro, and Intune Integration
Welcome to the AI-Driven Modern Workplace repository! This project demonstrates a comprehensive proof-of-concept for managing Apple devices in enterprise environments using Microsoft Intune, Jamf Pro, and Azure Sentinel. By leveraging advanced automation with AppleScript, shell scripts, and cloud technologies, this solution ensures seamless device management, security compliance, and dynamic workflow automation.

Introduction
In today’s enterprise environments, managing Apple devices at scale requires an intelligent, automated, and secure solution. This project integrates Microsoft Intune with Jamf Pro, coupled with Azure Sentinel, to deliver robust device management and compliance capabilities for macOS systems. By automating workflows and enforcing dynamic security policies, this solution helps organizations ensure:

Seamless device enrollment and provisioning.
Automated compliance monitoring and real-time threat detection.
Custom workflows based on user roles and dynamic device behavior.
Advanced device-level automation through AppleScript and shell scripts.
This repository serves as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the possibilities of this integration. For a full-scale implementation, customized workflows, and advanced compliance enforcement, please contact me for consulting services.

Key Features
Unified Apple Device Management: Seamless integration of Microsoft Intune and Jamf Pro for centralized management and compliance enforcement of macOS devices.
Real-Time Security Analytics: Integration with Azure Sentinel to provide real-time monitoring, compliance reports, and threat detection.
Dynamic Compliance Policies: Automatically enforce security policies based on device behavior, ensuring devices remain secure and compliant.
Custom Automation via AppleScript: Deploy AppleScript and shell scripts for macOS-specific automation, enhancing device configuration and management.
Zero-Touch Enrollment: Automate macOS device provisioning using Apple Business Manager (ABM) and Device Enrollment Program (DEP).
Note: This is a proof-of-concept repository, showcasing the potential of this integration. For full implementation, enterprise-specific customizations, and advanced features, please contact me to discuss how I can tailor the solution to meet your organization’s unique needs.

Proof of Concept
Below are a few proof-of-concept examples demonstrating basic automations and integrations. These examples will give you an idea of the capabilities but are not a full implementation. For more advanced solutions, feel free to reach out!

1. Automated macOS Application Installation with AppleScript
This script checks if Slack is installed on the device. If not, it downloads and installs the application. This serves as a basic demonstration of device-level automation using AppleScript.

applescript
Copy code
tell application "System Events"
    if not (exists application "Slack") then
        do shell script "curl -O https://downloads.slack-edge.com/mac_releases/Slack-4.0.0.dmg"
        do shell script "hdiutil attach Slack-4.0.0.dmg"
        do shell script "cp -r /Volumes/Slack/Slack.app /Applications/"
        do shell script "hdiutil detach /Volumes/Slack"
        display dialog "Slack has been installed successfully."
    else
        display dialog "Slack is already installed on this device."
    end if
end tell
Example Use Case: Automatically ensure critical applications like Slack or Microsoft Teams are installed on all macOS devices during device provisioning.

2. Dynamic Security Policy Enforcement (Shell Script)
The following shell script ensures that the macOS firewall is enabled and enforces the use of stealth mode when abnormal device behavior is detected by Azure Sentinel.

bash
Copy code
# Check and enable macOS firewall
firewall_status=$(defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate)
if [ "$firewall_status" -ne 1 ]; then
    /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
    /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on
    echo "Firewall and stealth mode have been enabled."
else
    echo "Firewall is already enabled."
fi
Example Use Case: This script can be deployed through Jamf Pro to dynamically enforce security settings based on real-time analytics from Azure Sentinel.

Advanced Features (Available Through Consultation)
The following features are part of a more complex and tailored solution, available through consulting or freelance services. They provide advanced functionality and enterprise-level security:

Dynamic User-Based Access Control: Role-based access control and policy enforcement using Azure Active Directory Conditional Access and Jamf Pro. Users such as developers and administrators can have different levels of device and network access based on their roles.

Real-Time Compliance Remediation: Automatically enforce device compliance based on abnormal behavior, using data analytics from Azure Sentinel and device management via Intune and Jamf Pro.

Zero-Touch Deployment with Post-Enrollment Configuration: Devices are enrolled via DEP, with post-enrollment configuration automatically applied via AppleScript and Jamf policies for seamless onboarding.

Centralized Compliance Reporting with Power BI: Real-time dashboards providing compliance status, security reports, and automated alerts for non-compliant devices.
